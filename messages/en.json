    "intro": "Finca Emmita is 10 mins drive from El Perello and 20 mins from the sea, we are in the middle of a valley, with no neighbours or roads nearby. All you can hear is the sound of silence. The finca is 100% self-sufficient. It is solar powered, we collect rain water and the grey water is recycled to water the vegetable garden and plants. We offer also high speed internet.",
    "highlight": "IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PEACE, QUIET, DISCONNECTION AND ENJOYING MOTHER NATURE, this is the place.",
    "elPerello": "The nearest village is El Perello, a small town which sits back 5 kilometres from the sea. Because of this it has not been developed as a tourist resort, and maintains a rustic charm. It is only a small town, but has all the facilities, cafe bars, restaurants, shops of all sorts, a small super-market, banks, a laundrette, a pharmacy and clinic, and a tourist office. There are internet facilities, and international newspapers are available at the newsagents. On Saturday morning there is a local market. El Perello is also famous for his local honey."
