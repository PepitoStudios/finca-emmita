# Remove Page Sections and Update Navigation

## Problem/Goal
The navigation currently has links to non-existent pages (/la-casita, /la-olivita, /activities, /contact) that result in 404 errors. Since this is a single-page website, these should be converted to smooth scroll anchors to existing sections. Additionally, the topbar text is not visible when transparent over the hero image due to dark text colors.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Remove navigation links to non-existent pages (La Casita, La Olivita, Activities, Contact)
- [x] Add smooth scroll anchors to existing page sections (Accommodations, Location, Contact/CTA)
- [x] Update navigation items to scroll to these anchors instead of routing to pages
- [x] Fix topbar text colors to be white/visible when transparent over hero
- [x] Text colors properly transition to dark when scrolled/background becomes white
- [x] Both desktop and mobile navigation updated
- [x] Smooth scroll behavior implemented

## Context Manifest

### Implementation Summary

**Navigation Architecture:**
- Single-page website using hash-based navigation (#hero, #accommodations, #location, #contact)
- Header component tracks scroll state and passes to Navigation via props
- Navigation uses Intersection Observer to detect active section
- Smooth scroll handlers with browser history support (window.history.pushState)

**Key Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added section IDs
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Fixed subtitle color (white when transparent)
- `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx` - Hash navigation, scroll state colors, Intersection Observer
- `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` - Updated to hash anchors
- `messages/en.json` & `messages/es.json` - Updated navigation translations

**Styling System:**
- Tailwind CSS v4 with custom theme (earth, nature, sage, accent color palettes)
- Conditional text colors based on scroll state (white transparent, dark scrolled)
- Framer Motion for animated active indicators
- `cn()` utility for conditional class merging

**Accessibility:**
- Focus management for keyboard navigation
- Error handling for querySelector
- Deep linking support with URL hash
- Mobile menu auto-close on navigation
