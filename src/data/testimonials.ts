Emma is a wonderful host who made us feel so welcome. The self-sufficiency of the finca is impressive - solar power, rainwater collection - it felt good to stay somewhere so eco-friendly.',

We spent our days hiking in the valley and our nights stargazing - no light pollution at all! Emma gave us great recommendations for local spots. Will definitely come back.',
